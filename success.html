                <p class="mt-3">"Bash Ali helped with our Family Sponsorship to get me from Cleveland, Ohio, to Mississauga, ON. He was very professional and knowledgeable during all stages, of the entire process. Most importantly he was very honest, and very helpful anytime I needed information, during the process. He would answer my calls, texts, or emails anytime of day. He was able to keep me calm and level headed, when becoming stressed about the process! Bash continually checked up on me while waiting to be approved, and kept me updated, anytime we received anything from CPC!!! Our Family Sponsorship was approved 4 months after submitting our paperwork!! So now I’m in Mississauga with my wife!!!! I would highly recommend anyone to use Bash Ali & Associates, for their immigrating process to Canada!!!"</p>

                <p class="mt-3">I was issued a removal order at the Port of Entry as I accidently missed to both declare and have medically examined my wife and son before immigrating to Canada under Federal Skilled Worker category. However, upon examination by the immigration officials at the airport, I explained them the reasons for not disclosing my dependent family members. Unfortunately, I was advised by the officer that it was too late and I was not allowed to become a Permanent Resident of Canada but was given the appeal opportunity at Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) to challenge the legal validity of my removal orders. I appealed the removal orders and retained the professional services of Bash Ali & Associates in Toronto to represent my case before the IAD. I am very happy that after a quality representation and a thorough preparation by Mr. Bash and his associate Mr. Lou, my appeal was allowed at the first hearing. I was able to retain my permanent resident status after winning my IAD appeal. Afterwards, they also assisted me to bring my wife and son to Canada who have also been granted permanent resident status recently and are joining me permanently in Canada in the next two months. I found Mr. Bash and Mr. Lou to be thorough gentlemen, knowledgeable, experienced and friendly team to work with, no matter how complex IAD appeal matter is to be challenged. I have no words in my dictionary to explain my relief and happiness due to their tireless efforts given to my case. I remain obliged for both of them for their genuine commitment and hard work in winning my appeal. God bless both of you always... Paul</p>

He consistently updates and follows through, which puts the client at ease of mind. Overall, I recommend Basharat for any immigration related services because I can almost guarantee that it will be done to your utmost satisfaction."</p>

                <p class="mt-3">Prior to going to Bash I was referred to another immigration consultant that I wasn't satisfied with. I was concerned that it would be difficult to find an honest person who wouldn't take advantage of an already difficult situation. I was in search of an immigration consultant who would handle a spousal refusal and I decided to search online. After reading reviews I selected Bash Ali & Associates. I was a bit skeptical at the beginning but when I met Bash I knew he was an honest guy. It was emotional for me but he had me laughing and smiling all the time. He was honest and confident and reassured me that he will win this case and get my husband here. There were no surprises with Bash as he explained everything including his fees. He told me exactly what to expect and also what information he required from me. He tells you as it is and is also very funny at the same time. He handled my appeal and it was successful. My husband will be here shortly. I will certainly refer him in the future as he is a man of his word.</p>

As we were in India, it would be a difficult task to have a face to face chat with skype. Bash always kept his professionalism and always made sure that he could be approachable at any point in time. We had some issues with our UK visa refusal and he made sure that, if any issue arises out of this, he would be taking care of that, which was a great relief to us. Definitely, he is a person where we could seek help without any second thoughts. A+++"</p>

                <p class="mt-3">I seeked the help of Mr. Bash Ali to help me on how to sponsor my Mother In-Law as she was already denied twice applying for a tourist visa. Mr. Bash Ali gave me and my wife professional advise and so we hired his services to process and apply a Super Visa for my Mother In-Law. Within two weeks, we got a result and she was approved for a Super Visa and tonight at 9:30pm September 29, 2017 we are heading to Pearson International Airport to pick up my Mother In-Law as she is arriving from Philippines. Thank you Mr. Bash for all your help. Without your professional help and advice, my Mother In-Law could not have been issued a Visa to visit us here in Canada. In 2014, he also helped me sponsor our 4 children with his professional advise.</p>

He took every piece of documents I had with me at the time, reviewed my immigration history thoroughly and even consulted one of his senior fellows. He did all this to give me the best advice and work something out for me and my wife. He utilized the best of his skills and efforts and finally got me unconditional permanent residency in Canada. It is Bash who guided me through complicated situations, coached me how to be ready for immigration interviews and won the freedom for me. His work style is marvelous and so friendly, makes everyone feel special. Great work done</p>

                <p class="mt-3">I'm an Egyptian national. My husband is a Syrian who lives and works in Canada. Due to a number of tough political circumstances, my husband wasn't able to visit me in Egypt and I couldn't visit him in Canada, thus we decided to meet in Malaysia, got married in the Egyptian embassy in Kuala Lumpur, our sponsorship process wasn't' an easy one, because our marriage was performed in the embassy, we also had an age difference, and all other political circumstances were against us. My husband came to Mr. Bash's office. Mr. Bash has analyzed and studied our case, our files, documents and he made sure to submit everything correctly. In less than 6 months I got an email from Cairo VO informing me that my visa has been issued and I happily was able and for the first time to travel to Canada and reunite with my husband.</p>

                <p class="mt-3">I am very grateful to the professional and experienced immigration advice given to me by the team of Bash Ali & Associates Immigration Consulting Services located in Toronto Canada. We were strongly recommended their services from one of their former happy clients who was already in Canada through their immigration advice. My wife, a Canadian citizen sponsored me from Pakistan with the assistance of our immigration representative Mr. Bash Ali, who was very committed and knowledgeable with Canadian immigration rules regarding family spousal sponsorship process. He and his staff took care of our a bit complex case and presented everything to the visa officer professionally leading us for a positive decision without any personal interview. I was given permanent residence visa and now in the process of travelling to Canada to be permanently reunited with my wife to start a brand new life in a brand new country. We have no words of gratitude to the entire team of Bash Ali & Associates. Thanks a million Mr. Bash and we will definitely going to recommend anyone who needs experienced and committed legal representation for immigration related matters. Freesa & Noman Salim</p>

He is an excellent lawyer– very professional and knowledgeable. Bash always returned my calls or emails whenever I had a question or concern, even when I had to talk to him during his days off. It is so nice to be able to express your concerns to him and have things explained to you without being rushed or bombarded with terms you don’t understand. Our whole family is very pleased with Bash Ali & Associates…he is just awesome. And We are very happy that my husband finally is PR resident in canada. Thank you Bash for everything."</p>

                <p class="mt-3">I retained the services of Bash Ali & Associates as one of my friends referred me for the sponsorship of my child who was denied three time previously including a negative appeal at Immigration Appeal Division, Toronto. I was hopeless and was devastated with no hope in future. However, after meeting with Mr. Bash Ali, he researched and reviewed my case history and assured me that there was a legal error made both by the Visa Officer and the Board Member of the Immigration Appeal Division. He informed me that my son should not have been found excluded by immigration visa officer and appeal division. He suggested me to re-apply a brand new child sponsorship application which we did. Mr. Bash was very confident to take up the case and I trusted his knowledge and decided to move ahead. After almost 2 years of lengthy processing, my son was finally issued with permanent residence visa and he will be travelling to Canada at the end of this month. I just can't believe my luck that Mr. Bash Ali came through with his words. I have no words to say how grateful I am for his commitment and dedication in winning an almost impossible case for me. I must recommend his professional services to everyone looking for trusted and experienced immigration advice. Love you and thanks a million Mr. Bash.</p>

                <p class="mt-3">I had engaged Bash Ali & Associates regarding my parents' sponsorship case. Their case was rather complicated as they were previously in Canada on refugee status and due to some unfortunate circumstances, had to leave the country. Even though they had complied with all the immigration regulations, they were considered deported. Due to which, they were required to submit an ARC (Authorization to Return to Canada) application. Due to Mr.Bash's keen knowledge of the immigration law, professionalism and dedication to his clients, my parents' ARC was approved in just 4 months and they have now landed in Canada as Permanent Residents. He was available for help and guidance at every step of the way and I cannot thank him enough for re-uniting our family. He is extremely detail-oriented, which is an absolute must when it comes to immigration matters and especially in a case as complicated as my parents'. I have nothing but high praise for Mr.Bash and would recommend him to anyone looking for Professional immigration advise.</p>

                <p class="mt-3">I almost lost hope after losing my MY PR status at an admissibility hearing until I contacted the team of Bash Ali & Associates. They fully prepared me for my IAD appeal and professionally and compassionately represented me at my IAD hearing. They presented my case so strongly at IAD that the Minister had to consent and my appeal was allowed on the bench. It was unbelievable as my case was very complex. I have no words to say thank you to Basharat Ali who personally represented me at IAD with Lou Di Tosto. They have been very helpful, compassionate and committed in winning my IAD appeal. All along, they supported me morally and emotionally and always lifted me when I was down being away from family for almost 3 years as my life was hanging up in the air until the day of my IAD appeal hearing. I owe my life to them and will never ever forget their sincere efforts in helping me win my complex and hard to win case. Well-done Bash and team... Paul</p>

He is very detailed oriented and up to date with any latest changes to the immigration policies. He also provided his assistance for acquiring Super visa for my grand mother after her initial application got rejected when I filed her case personally. Bash provided assistance in filing the case again and guided through the re-application process that resulted in getting super visa application accepted the second time. Overall, I have positive working experience with Bash with positive results and I appreciate his professional services and have recommended many of my friends to him who are looking for professional help or assistance for immigration related matters. I highly recommend anyone who is looking for such services to give Bash a call. You will not be disappointed.</p>

Bash was very honest with us, making us understand what the problem was and how to logically handle it. He is very approachable, easy to talk to and easily accessible when needed for questions etc. I wish I had gone to him from the beginning rather than wait it out and try to handle matters of the government by myself. If it wasn't for him, I am sure my wife's case would have been rejected.</p>

I found them to be a team of highly dedicated and knowledgeable professionals who knows all about immigration policies and procedures. I met Bash when I had just few days to leave Canada due to expiration of my post-graduate work permit. Bash assisted by restoring my status in Canada, not only that; Bash also handled my Canadian Experience Class application very carefully that even when I left Canada, Bash ensured that any correspondence from immigration gets to me in a timely manner. In 9 months I obtained my Permanent Residence both for myself and my spouse. We are very happy to make Canada our new home. I will recommend Bash Ali to everyone seeking an honest, knowledgeable and fully accessible immigration consultant as he will meet all your immigration needs of any category. I want to say a big thank you to Bash Ali & Associate and his entire team for a job well-done. Please keep up the good work. David 6477188512</p>

                <h4>In Canada Family Class Sponsorship Approved</h4>  
                <p class="mt-3">Canada is a land of opportunities and I came to Canada as an international student to pursue the same dream and to finally become permanent resident of Canada someday. However, after consulting with few immigration counsels, I was not satisfied with their quality of advice. A few of the counsels even suggested me some unfair ways to get the immigration. Luckily, I heard about Bash Ali & Associates from a friend of mine. I finally went to Bash Ali & Associates and met with Mr. Basharat (Bash) Ali in person, he listened to all of my immigration concerns, I felt very comfortable after talking to him as I found him to be very caring, supportive, knowledgeable and a flexible and highly like able gentleman. He personally processed and worked very hard on my in-Canada spousal sponsorship application. He prepared and presented the facts and quality of supporting evidence to Citizenship and Immigration Caanada to prove the genuineness of my marital relationship with my Canadian spouse in such a professional way that I was waived my spousal sponsorship interview with local CIC immigration officer. My case was so complex that many of my friends got surprised to hear about the approval of my sponsorship application without any interview. However, with the sincere efforts and professional guidance of Basharat Ali, I was recently granted permanent residence status of Canada under in-Canada family class sponsorship. I and my wife are highly grateful to the team of Bash Ali & Associates. We love to refer their services for anyone interested for family class immigration category as they are true expert in delivering positive results. Love ya Bash…keep up your excellent work….you changed my life in a very profound way and I am grateful to you for life. Muhammad Ali</p>

I was very skeptical about initiating my immigration process through a Lawyer due to past experiences however, Mr. Bash not only convinced me with his knowledge and acumen but also surprised me with his friendly vibes and down-to-earth nature. He is a thorough gentleman with professionalism and work ethics. He meticulously scrutinize each and every documents along with the application. So, without any nuisances I got my PR status within 8 months along with my family. I am so thankful to Mr. Bash for guiding and helping us. At all times he has been thoughtful, time responsive, and conscientious. He is a Lawyer par excellence. I was really satisfied with his service and greatly appreciate his work. I will always have high regards for him as a lawyer and as a friend. I would highly recommend Bash Ali & Associates for immigration services...</p>
