                          Congrats!!!!! You have finally met the love of your life, your better half…Your spouse is presently residing in Canada on either a visitor, student or a temporary work visa.  You both have decided to get married in Canada…now how to keep your loved one “your better half” to continue residing in Canada with you permanently?

                           <br>

                          As per section 123 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR), Spouse or Common-Law Partner in Canada Class (SCLPC), the spouse or common-law partner in Canada class is hereby prescribed as a class of persons who may become permanent residents on the basis of the requirements of this Division.
  
                           <br>
                           124 A foreign national is a member of the spouse or common-law partner in Canada class if they
                           <br>
                          (a)are the spouse or common-law partner of a sponsor and cohabit with that sponsor in Canada;
                          <br>
                          (b)have temporary resident status in Canada; and
                          <br>
                          (c)are the subject of a sponsorship application.
 
                           <br>
                           In order for meeting the regulatory requirements to apply under the SCLPC stream, the married couple must be cohabiting in a conjugal relationship under the same roof.  This is one of the key components of applying and availing this stream among other requirements.  The foreign national must also maintain their temporary residence status in Canada while their application for permanent residency under the SCPLC category is being processed.

 <br>

Openwork permit pilot program for permanent residence applicants in the spouse or common-law partner in Canada class (LMIA exemption code A70)
 
<br>
The foreign national is also eligible to apply for an open work permit while their application for permanent residency under this category is being processed.  They can either submit both the application for permanent residence and application for an open work permit at the same time or can submit at a later stage.  However, submitting both of the applications at the same time is highly recommended.  The open work permit application is processed within about 4 months from submitting the application to Case Processing Centre in Mississauga.
                        </p>


                        <p>
                          Eligibility for an open work permit:
 

Officers will issue open work permits to SCLPC class applicants if they meet the following requirements:

 

a permanent residence application has been submitted under the SCLPC class and is currently being processed, or has been received, by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada for processing
a Canadian citizen or permanent resident spouse has submitted a sponsorship application on their behalf
the SCLPC class applicant resides at the same address as the sponsor
the SCLPC class applicant has valid temporary resident status (as a visitor, student or worker), or is eligible to restore their temporary resident status, and has submitted the restoration application with their application for permanent residence
 

The following foreign nationals do not qualify for the open work permit pilot program:

 

applicants who have applied for permanent residence under the SCLPC class and have been refused or have withdrawn that application before submitting the open work permit pilot application
applicants whose application for permanent residence is being processed under the spousal public policy (subcategory “PP” in the Global Case Management System [GCMS]) on the basis that they do not have a valid temporary resident status (these applicants must wait until they receive approval in principle to be eligible to apply for an open work permit)
applicants who have applied as members of the overseas family class, including those living in Canada
applicants applying for the work permit pilot program at a port of entry
 

                        </p>
                        <div class="quote-wrapper">
                           <div class="quotes">
                            Case processing centers will ensure that the requirements for the open work permit pilot program are met. They will also conduct system checks to identify any adverse information, on either the sponsor or the applicant, that would render the applicant ineligible for an open work permit.

 

If there is information that an applicant is inadmissible, their application for an open work permit will be placed on hold until a decision is made regarding their permanent residence application and the inadmissibility.

 

In situations where a temporary resident permit is issued to the applicant to overcome inadmissibility and where the person is an applicant for permanent residence under the SCLPC class, they may be issued an open work permit under this pilot program

 

TRAVEL OUTSIDE CANADA WHILE APPLICATION IS UNDER PROCESSING:
 

Please be advised that while your application is being processed under this category, it is highly advisable to restrict yours out of country travel to a minimum.  However, there are exceptions for making short trips for emergency reasons.  If for whatever reasons, you think that one of your physical absences from Canada is imminent for a longer period of stay, you must not apply using the SCLPC category.  Instead, you should consider applying from the Out-side Canada sponsorship application.

                        </div>
                        <p>
                          Excluded relationships:

 

125(1) A foreign national shall not be considered a member of the spouse or common-law partner in Canada class by virtue of their relationship to the sponsor if
(a)the foreign national is the sponsor’s spouse or common-law partner and is under 18 years of age;
(b)the foreign national is the sponsor’s spouse or common-law partner, the sponsor has an existing sponsorship undertaking in respect of a spouse or common-law partner and the period referred to in subsection 132(1) in respect of that undertaking has not ended;
(c)the foreign national is the sponsor’s spouse and
(i)the sponsor or the spouse was, at the time of their marriage, the spouse of another person, or
(ii)the sponsor has lived separate and apart from the foreign national for at least one year and
(A)the sponsor is the common-law partner of another person or the sponsor has a conjugal partner, or
(B)the foreign national is the common-law partner of another person or the conjugal partner of another sponsor;
 

SPONSOR’S ELIGIBILITY:

 

Sponsor

130(1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3), a sponsor, for the purpose of sponsoring a foreign national who makes an application for a permanent resident visa as a member of the family class or an application to remain in Canada as a member of the spouse or common-law partner in Canada class under subsection 13(1) of the Act, must be a Canadian citizen or permanent resident who
(a)is at least 18 years of age;
(b)resides in Canada; and
(c)has filed a sponsorship application in respect of a member of the family class or the spouse or common-law partner in Canada class in accordance with section 10.
Five-year sponsorship bar
 

A person who became a permanent resident or a Canadian citizen after being sponsored as spouse, common-law partner or conjugal partner is barred from sponsoring a spouse or partner within five years of becoming a permanent resident, even if they acquired citizenship during that period.

 

A sponsor who became a permanent resident or a Canadian citizen after being sponsored as a spouse, common-law partner or conjugal partner under subsection 13(1) of the Act may not sponsor a foreign national referred to in subsection (1) as a spouse, common-law partner or conjugal partner unless the sponsor has been a permanent resident or a Canadian citizen, or a combination of the two, for a period of at least five years immediately preceding the day on which a sponsorship application referred to in paragraph (1)(c) is filed by the sponsor in respect of the foreign national.

 

Your obligations as a sponsor

 

When you agree to be a sponsor, you must sign an undertaking, promising to give financial support for the basic needs of your spouse or partner and their dependent children.

 

Basic needs are:

 

food, clothing, shelter and other needs for everyday living,
dental care, eye care and other health needs that aren’t covered by public health services.
 

Before signing the undertaking agreement, you must make sure the people you sponsor won’t need to ask the government for financial help. If they receive social assistance, you’ll have to pay back what they received during the time you are legally responsible for them. You won’t be able to sponsor anyone else until you’ve repaid the amount.

 

The undertaking is a binding promise of support, meaning that it is your responsibility to support the applicant(s) for the length of the undertaking period even if your situation changes. The undertaking will stay in effect for the length of the undertaking period, even if your situation changes. The undertaking won’t be canceled, even if:

 

the person you sponsor becomes a Canadian citizen
you become divorced, separated or your relationship with the sponsored person breaks down
you or the person you sponsor move to another province or country
you have financial problems
 

May I cancel my undertaking after it’s been approved?

 

If you change your mind after you submit the sponsorship application and undertaking, you must write us a letter before a final decision is made on the file and submit the letter as an attachment through the IRCC Webform. You can only withdraw an undertaking if we approve the withdrawal.

 

Length of undertaking:

 

Your obligations as a sponsor start as soon as the undertaking is in effect. If you change your mind after you submit the sponsorship application and undertaking, you must write IRCC a letter before a final decision is made on the file and submit the letter as an attachment through their IRCC Webform. You can only withdraw an undertaking if we approve the withdrawal.

 

You’re sponsoring a spouse, common-law partner or conjugal partner
 

Length of undertaking is 3 years from the day your spouse, common-law partner or conjugal partner becomes a permanent resident.

 

You’re sponsoring a dependent child over 22 years of age
 

The length of an undertaking is 3 years from the day your dependent child (or the dependent child of your spouse, common-law partner or conjugal partner) over 22 years of age becomes a permanent resident.

 

You’re sponsoring a dependent child under 22 years of age
 

Length of an undertaking is 10 years from the day your dependent child (or the dependent child of your spouse, common-law partner or conjugal partner) under 22 years of age becomes a permanent resident, or until the child becomes 22 years old, whichever comes first.

 

You can become a sponsor if you are:

 

at least 18 years old
a Canadian citizen or a permanent resident,
living in Canada:
able to prove that you are not receiving social assistance for reasons other than a disability, and;
 

You must also be able to show that you can provide basic needs for:

 

yourself,
your spouse or partner,
your spouse or partner’s dependent child(ren) (if applicable)
your dependent child(ren) (if you’re sponsoring only your dependent child).
 

Note: In most cases, there is no low-income-cut-off (LICO) for spouse, partner or dependent child sponsorships. However, if either a spouse or partner you’re sponsoring has as dependent child who has dependent children of their own, or a dependent child you are sponsoring has a dependent child of their own, you must meet a minimum LICO score, which is determined by the Canadian government each year.

 

You may not be able to sponsor if you…
 

are sponsoring a spouse or partner but you signed an undertaking for a previous spouse or partner and it hasn’t been three years since they became a permanent resident,
previously sponsored someone and did not pay back any social assistance that they received while the undertaking was in place.
are in default on an immigration loan or a performance bond
did not pay court-ordered alimony or child support
have declared bankruptcy which has not been discharged
were convicted of
an offence of a sexual nature,
a violent crime,
an offense against a relative that caused bodily harm or
threatened or attempted to commit any of the above offenses—depending on the nature of the offense, how long ago it happened and if you received a pardon
are sponsoring a spouse or partner and you were previously sponsored as a spouse, common-law or conjugal partner and became a permanent resident of Canada less than five years ago,
are under a removal order,
are in a penitentiary, jail, reformatory or prison,
