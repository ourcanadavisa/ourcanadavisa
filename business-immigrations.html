                <p style="color: black">
                    Canada needs investors, business managers, and experienced entrepreneurs who are
interested in settling and seeking new opportunities in Canada to apply to number of
Business Immigration Programs. Your experience and business expertise are
valuable assets that can help you invest in your future with Canada’s fast-growing
stable and diverse economy.
                </p><br>
				<h3>Federal Business Immigration Programs:</h3>
                <br>
                <p>There are two Federal business immigration programs currently open to
international business individuals as follows:</p>
            <br><br>
            <h3>1 - Self-employed Persons:</h3><br>
            <p>To qualify as a self-employed person, you must have two years of relevant
experience and demonstrate that you have genuine intention and ability to
economically establish by becoming self-employed in Canada.
You must also score at least 35 points on a selection grid designed to determine
whether you will be able to make an economic contribution to Canada as a self-
employed person.</p><br><br>
<h3>2 - Start-up Visa Program:</h3>
<br>
<p>To qualify for the Start-up Visa Program, you must meet all of the following 4
eligibility requirements, as well as the admissibility requirements to enter Canada.</p>
<br><br>
<h3>Eligibility requirements for the Start-up Visa Program:</h3>
<br>
<p>You must:</p>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>1. have a qualifying business</li>
    <li>2. have a letter of support from a designated organization</li>
    <li>3. meet the language requirements, and</li>
    <li>4. have enough money to settle and live in Canada before you make money from
your business</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<h3>Provincial Nominee Programs for Business Immigration:</h3><br>

<p>Each province and territory operate its own PNP business immigration programs and
many of which have a category for candidates with entrepreneurial or senior
management experience.
The eligibility criteria and application procedure for each PNP category is different,
but successful applicants can receive a provincial nomination which will allow them
to later apply for permanent residence at the federal level.</p>
<br><br>
<h3>ONTARIO:</h3>
<br>
<p>The province of Ontario selects its own applicants under OINP-Entrepreneur stream
as follows:</p><br>
<p>The Entrepreneur Stream is an immigration stream under the Ontario Immigrant
Nominee Program (OINP).</p><br>
<p>This stream is for entrepreneurs from outside of Canada interested in starting a new
business or buying an existing business in Ontario.</p><br>
<p>It gives an entrepreneur (and up to one foreign national business partner) the
opportunity to be nominated for permanent residence once their business has been
established in Ontario.</p><br>
<p>If you are nominated, the next step will be to apply to the federal government
through Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC). They make the final
decision on who becomes a permanent resident.</p><br>
<p>Please review the following official weblink from Ontario government for more
details.</p><br>

<h3>New Brunswick Entrepreneurial Stream – Direct PR category</h3><br>
<p>The New Brunswick Entrepreneurial Stream is designed for experienced business
owners and senior managers who wish to become permanent residents by owning a
business in New Brunswick (NB) and managing it, while residing in the Province.
The New Brunswick Entrepreneurial Stream is an economic immigration program for
experienced entrepreneurs who are ready to establish, operate and actively manage a
business while living and settling in New Brunswick permanently.
When applying to any of New Brunswick’s immigration streams, you must be
Permanent Resident (PR) Ready. In the New Brunswick Entrepreneurial Stream, it
means that you meet all minimum eligibility requirements and selection factors and
have all the required documents on hand to prepare and submit a complete and
correct application to the Government of New Brunswick and to the Government of
Canada. Being PR Ready means more efficient processing, fewer delays and a better
experience navigating the New Brunswick and Canadian immigration programs. In
most cases, this means your application will be processed faster.</p>
<br><br>
<p>NBPNP applications require two stages of approval before PR status may be
obtained.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Stage 1: Application to the NBPNP for a nomination certificate</b><br><br>
If you meet all eligibility criteria and selection factors, you can apply to the NBPNP by
registering online and submitting an Expression of Interest (EOI). If an Invitation to
Apply (ITA) is sent to your attention, then you can submit a full application online. In
some cases, you may be asked to attend an interview.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Stage 2: Application to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada for a PR visa</b><br><br>
If you are nominated by PETL, you may then apply to the Government of Canada for
a PR visa, through Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC). In this case,
you will send your application to the IRCC Centralized Intake Office in Sydney, Nova
Scotia, Canada. You, your spouse and dependents under 22 years of age single and
never married must meet statutory requirements for medical, security and criminal
admissibility. IRCC has the final authority to issue a PR visa. There is no guarantee
that IRCC will approve your PR application even if you are issued a provincial
nominee certificate by the provincial government.
The New Brunswick Entrepreneurial Stream is open to foreign national
entrepreneurs or senior managers, living in Canada or abroad, who are ready to
establish, operate and actively manage a business while living and settling in New
Brunswick permanently. To apply to the stream, you must make sure that you meet
all eligibility requirements. If all eligibility requirements have been met, you will be
assessed according to the following selection: age, language, education, personal net
worth, business ownership and/or senior management experience, business concept
and adaptability. A minimum of <b>65 of 100 points</b> is required to be successful.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Age:</b><br><br>
You must be between 22-55 years of age. Your age is assessed as of the day that a
complete application is submitted to PETL in response to an Invitation to Apply (ITA).</p>
<br>
<p><b>Official languages:</b><br><br>
To meet the language requirement, you must submit valid test results from a
designated testing organization to show you have obtained a minimum score equal
to or greater than a Canadian Language Benchmark (CLB) 5 for English.</p>
<br>
<p>Valid language test results must be from one of the following designated language-
testing organizations:</p>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>1. International English Language Testing System (IELTS) General Training</li>
    <li>2. Canadian English Language Proficiency Index Program (CELPIP) General</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><b>Education:</b>
You must, at a minimum, have a two-year post-secondary education after high
school diploma equal to a Canadian credential. If you have a foreign education, you
will need an Educational Credential Assessment (ECA) report from a recognized
organization to show that your credential is valid and equal to a Canadian credential.
If you already have an ECA report, it must be less than five years old when IRCC
receives your PR application, should you receive a nomination certificate. You don’t
need an assessment for a Canadian degree, diploma or certificate.
<br>
To obtain an ECA Report, you must be assessed by an organization or a professional
body designated by IRCC. They will give you a report that tells you what your
education is equal to in Canada. Once you choose a designated organization or a
professional body, they will tell you how to submit your documents to get your
assessment. Designated organizations include:</p>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>1. Comparative Education Service (CES)</li>
    <li>2. International Credential Assessment Service of Canada (ICAS)</li>
    <li>3. World Education Services (WES)</li>
    <li>4. International Qualifications Assessment Service (IQAS)</li>
    <li>5. International Credential Evaluation Service (ICES)</li>
    <li>6. Medical Council of Canada (professional body for doctors)</li>
    <li>7. Pharmacy Examining Board of Canada (professional body for pharmacists)</li>
</ul>

business concept is of economic benefit to New Brunswick and operates for the
primary purpose of earning profits by providing products and/or services.
