                <br>

                    permanently. CEC is a part of Canada’s EE Immigration system.
                    The government of Canada recognizes the deep pool of talented workers already
                    working in Canada and wants them to become permanent residents. These are
                    individuals and families who have set down roots and made plans for the future in
                    Canada.</p>

                <h3 style="color: black;">EDUCATION:</h3><br>
                <p style="color: black;">There is no minimum education requirements for the Canadian Experience Class.
                    However, If you want to improve your rank in the EE pool for immigration purposes,
                    there are 2 ways you can do this.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you went to school in Canada, you could get points for a certificate, diploma
                            or degree from a Canadian:</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>secondary institution (high school) or</li>
                                <li>post-secondary institution</li>
                            </ul>

                </ul>
                <p><b>Or</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>. If you have foreign education, you can get points for:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>a completed foreign credential, and</li>
                        <li>an Educational Credential Assessment (ECA) report for immigration
                                purposes from a designated organization showing that your education
                                is equal to a completed certificate, diploma or degree from a Canadian:</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>secondary institution (high school) or</li>
                                    <li>post-secondary institution</li>
                                </ul>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h3>Where you can live in Canada:</h3>
                    <p>You must plan to live outside the province of Quebec. The province of Quebec
                    selects its own skilled workers. If you plan on living in Quebec, see Quebec-selected
                    skilled workers for more information.
                    When you fill out your profile, IRCC will ask you where you plan to live in Canada.
                    In order you to apply under CEC, you would still need to create an EE profile online
                    same as FSW.</p>
                <h3>What do you need to create your online Express Entry Profile?</h3>
                <p>Once you have determined your eligibility, the next step is to submit your Express
                Entry profile online. You will need the following three main documents.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. <b>English Language Test:</b> All Express Entry candidates must show proficiency
                in either English or French. You require official test scores from
                an approved language test in order to submit your profile. The test results
                should be valid and must have been issued within the past two years. The
                minimum score is CLB-7 which equals to 6.0 band across 4 language
                proficiency modules. As an alternative, you are also allowed to submit as
                proof of language proficiency in English a valid CELPIP General test.</li>
                <br>
                <li>2. <b>Educational Credentials Assessment (ECA):</b> The ECA is an evaluation of
                non-Canadian education by Canadian equivalency standards. Please note
                that education is only a mandatory requirement for the Federal Skilled
                Worker category, but it is recommended that CEC candidates also
                complete an ECA report, as education is an important component of the
                CRS overall score. An education credential assessment (ECA) report is
                valid for 5 years.
                Note: An ECA is not required for any educational programs completed in
                Canada.
                </li><br>
                <li>3. <b>Passport:</b> A valid passport is required in order for you to submit your
                Express Entry profile.Once you have these three documents, you will be able to create your
                Express Entry profile. Once submitted, you will be issued an EE profile
                number and your profile remains valid for 12 months into IRCC pool. You can
                at any point of time voluntarily withdraw from pool or make changes and
                update your profile. However, once expired after 12 months, you need to
                create a new EE profile.</li>
                <br>
                </ul>
                <h3>What is CRS (Comprehensive Ranking System)?</h3>
                <p>Canada’s Express Entry immigration selection system uses the Comprehensive
                Ranking System (CRS) to rank and select individuals who are eligible to immigrate to
                Canada under two federal economic immigration programs.
                When Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) performs an Express
                Entry draw from the online EE pool of candidates every other Wednesday in a
                month, the top-scoring candidates receive an Invitation to Apply (ITA) for permanent
                residence. The Comprehensive Ranking System is a dynamic, competitive system, the
                more points you obtain, the more likely it is that you will be invited to apply.
                Before being assigned a Comprehensive Ranking System score, individuals must first
                be eligible under one of the following programs:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Federal Skilled Worker (FSW)</li>
                    <li>Canadian Experience Class (CEC)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Candidates in the pool are assigned a Comprehensive Ranking System score out of
                1,200.</p>
                <br>
                <p>For single applicants without a spouse, there are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Up to 500 points available for core human capital factors, including age,
                level of education, language ability, and Canadian work experience.</li>
                    <li>Up to 100 points available for skill transferability factors; and</li>
                    <li>Up to 600 points available for additional factors (including a provincial
                nomination, a valid job offer, Canadian study experience, a siblings in
                Canada, and/or French language ability).</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>For candidates with an accompanying spouse or common-law partner, there are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Up to 460 points available for core human capital factors of the principal
                applicant;</li>
                <li>Up to 40 points for the core human capital factors of the spouse or
                common-law partner;</li>
                <li>Up to 100 points available for skill transferability factors; and</li>
                <li>Up to 600 points available for additional factors.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h3>What is ITA (Invitation to Apply)?</h3>
                <p>An invitation to apply is a document issued by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship
                Canada (IRCC) to highest ranking candidates in the Express Entry pool. With an
                Invitation to Apply (ITA), a candidate may apply for Canadian permanent residence
                (e-APR) within 60 days. This is an official application for permanent residency where
                the applicants are required to submit (upload) all of the supporting documents as
                per the document checklist. These are some of the examples of the supporting
                documents:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A valid IELTS (General) issued within past 2 years</li>
                    <li>ECA (Education Credential Assessment) issued within 5 years</li>
                    <li>Educational degrees and transcripts</li>
                    <li>Proof of funds (bank statements 6 months or updated bank certificate)</li>
                    <li>Proof of work experience (pay-stubs, contracts, work reference letters)</li>
                    <li>Passport and birth certificate copies</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Almost 80 percent of applications submitted through Express Entry are processed in
                six months or less but depends on the merits of each case.<br><br>
                Invited candidates may immigrate to Canada with their accompanying family
                members, if applicable. This may include a spouse (legally married) or common-law
                partner (12 months of cohabitation), as well as any dependent children under 22
                years of age and single/never married.</p>
